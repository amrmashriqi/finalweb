            <p>
              Hello, I’m Amr Mashriqi
and MUN conferences
are really important to
me. I’ve been attending
from the 8 th grade and
each conference has
helped me sharpen my
debate skills and ability
to compromise amongst
other things. These skills
translate seamlessly into
real-life situations and
can be an asset in any
issues that may rear their
heads in the future. This
ignited a Passion in MUN
and more importantly the
legal field as a career
path which is why as
deputy head of IT I will
ensure the conference
goes on without any
issue as a way to pay it
forward.
