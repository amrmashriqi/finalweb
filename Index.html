		<h1>What is AAMUN?</h1>
		<p>An experience designed to challenge participants with establishing order in an
uncertain world, that is AAMUN. Join us for this exciting opportunity to explore,
negotiate, and debate global issues from November 24-26 at the St. Regis Hotel.
Delegates will be aided by the experienced chairing panels and seasoned leadership
team to ensure a rich debate as they traverse various opinions and perspectives. We
encourage our delegates to think critically as they attempt to set the world around
them in place Equipping them with the skills necessary for becoming essential to their
communities as leaders. AAMUN creates an intellectual atmosphere perfect for
cultivating the future thinkers of the nation into the innovators they are destined to
be. Staying true to our goal, we have chosen the theme of "Controlling the Chaos"
believing that recent events have caused much instability in the world providing a
suitable challenge for our delegates. We hope you join us for this exhilarating
experience and answer the golden question of how will you control the chaos?</p>

Secretary General</h3>
            <p>
          Hello everyone! I'm Faris
Akel, and I am honored to be
this conference's secretary
general. I was first introduced
into the world of MUNs in 8th
grade, and ever since then it's
been one of those events I've
always looked forward to.
MUNs taught me more about
myself, helped me meet new
people (who I still contact and
hold dear to this day), and
create memories I will never
forget. I hope you will have a
similar incredible experience
with us at AAMUN '22. Please
join as we dismantle intricate
topics, build amended bullet-
proof resolutions, and of
course, have fruitful debate.
See you November 24th!
